# RigidBit-Connectors

These are the officially supported connectors of the primary [RigidBit](https://github.com/RigidBit/RigidBit) application. Connectors extend the functionality of RigidBit, allowing it to interface with services that are not part of the core application.

## Connectors

### ethereum.py

Ethereum / Ethereum Classic sync connector written in Python 3. This connector uses a local [Geth](https://geth.ethereum.org/) daemon to broadcast transactions.

### ethereum_infura.py

Ethereum / Ethereum Classic sync connector written in Python 3. This connector uses [Infura](https://infura.io/) to broadcast transactions.

### ethereum.sol

Ethereum / Ethereum Classic smart contract used by the connector scripts for storing and verifying RigidBit information.
